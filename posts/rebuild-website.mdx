welcome to my new personal site~

my [old one](https://www.phil-chan.ca) was made straight outta bootcamp and never even completed LOL, wanted a redo so here we are with a new domain and a fresh makeover ðŸ˜Š

i was also inspired by various developer blogs i've discovered while researching material here n there, all of which have convinced me
to start being more proactive and use this website as both a blog and a testing ground to experiment with tools.

## so what else is new?

- language: js â†’ ts
- framework: react â†’ preact
- meta framework: next.js
- architecture: SPA â†’ SSR â†’ SSG
- hosting provider: netlify â†’ vercel
- content: `.mdx`
- css solution: sass â†’ styled components â†’ tailwind
