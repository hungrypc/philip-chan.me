welcome to my new personal website!

my [old one](https://www.phil-chan.ca) was made fresh outta bootcamp, it's outdated and no longer reflects me so i decided to do a revamp ðŸ˜Š

i was also inspired by various developer blogs i've discovered while researching material here n there, all of which have convinced me
to start being more proactive and use this website as both a blog and a testing ground to experiment with tools.

## how'd i even get here?

- language: js â†’ ts
- framework: jQuery â†’ react â†’ preact
- meta framework: none â†’ next.js
- architecture: SPA â†’ SSR â†’ SSG (*try ISG via cloudfront)
- hosting provider: netlify â†’ AWS
- content: none â†’ `.mdx`
- css solution: css â†’ sass â†’ styled components â†’ tailwind
